## Requirements
1.- Node and NPM.

## Installation
1.- Clone the repo
2.- Run the yarn install or npm install command in your terminal

## How to run the app
Once that you have cloned the repo and that you have installed the dependencies, just run:
yarn start or npm run start.

## How to run the unit tests
Once that you have cloned the repo and that you have installed the dependencies, just run:
yarn test or npm run test.

## How can I make changes in the repo

The branches are the next:
Master  ----- For production purposes.
development ----- For Qa testing purposes
your-branch ----- One branch should be created from development for every task or SC.

So, every that want to make changes in this project, you will need to pull the latest changes from the development branch and create a new branch from development (you can name the branch as you want); once the changes be made, you will need to create a PR pointing to development with your new changes.
